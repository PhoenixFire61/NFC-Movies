# NFC-Movies

Here I share designs that I made for movies that can be printed or applied onto PVC NFC cards.
Do keep in mind that if you want to print these directly onto PVC cards, that they need to have an inkjet printable coating ontop. Unless you have an expensive professional printer that doesn't need this, but in gerenal for your average person, you will need the inkjet prinable cards.

I have also uploaded a template so you can make your own. If you do I only ask that you share them with the words so it can motivate others to do the same.
