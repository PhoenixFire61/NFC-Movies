Here I share designs that I made for movies that can be printed or applied onto PVC NFC cards.
My designs have the CoreELEC (Just enough Linux to run Kodi) logo on the back because this is the media player/OS that I use to play all of my movies. If you want something different you can always use the template I will provide to make your own variant. If you do decide to do so I only ask that you share them with the world so it can motivate others to do the same. I'd love to see what you guys cook up!

Do keep in mind that if you want to print these directly onto PVC cards, that they need to have an inkjet printable coating on top (unless you have an expensive professional printer that doesn't need the extra coating).
